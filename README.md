# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
A school district asked for a snapshot of several key metrics by each school campus and by the district level.  The main analysis focused on the performance of math and reading scores disaggregated several ways in preparation for a board meeting.  However, after the school board reviewed the data, it was determined that the data from Thomas High School's 9th grade class was suspect of cheating.  The school board asked for the data to be removed and analyzed again for a comparison.
