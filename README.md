# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
A school district asked for an original analysis of math and reading scores prepared for their board meeting.  However, after the School Board reviewed the data, it was determined that the data from Thomas High School's 9th grade data was suspect of cheating.  The school board asked for the data to be removed and analyzed again.
